# oura_dashboard

Playing around with Oura data.

Goal is to implement lightweight streamlit web app that anybody could use with their own oura data by just providing their personal API token.

Or just use some dummy data provided

You can find/create your Personal Access Token here: https://cloud.ouraring.com/personal-access-tokens
