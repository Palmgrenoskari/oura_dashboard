# oura_dashboard

Playing around with Oura data.

**Live at:** https://ouradashboard.streamlit.app/

Goal is to implement lightweight streamlit web app that anybody could use with their own oura data by just providing their personal API token.

Or just use some of the limited dummy data provided.

You can find/create your Personal Access Token here: https://cloud.ouraring.com/personal-access-tokens

---

TO DO:
1) Better and more graphs, charts and infographics
2) Login system to store your API
3) Optimizations
4) Webhooks? Oura API does have webhook support but not sure if Oura updates your data frequently enough for some kind of live dashboard
